narrative_job_proxy
===================

Thin wrapper for the user_and_job_state service that allows querying jobs as the narrative job listener user

This is strictly a workaround

Note nexus client requires paramiko 1.12.1. 1.13 breaks it

This is essentially a module of the narrative. Please see release notes for the narrative for changes.
